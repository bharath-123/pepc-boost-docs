## üìù ToB Auction Architecture

One of the interesting features in PEPC-boost is the ToB (Top of Block) auction.

Within this auction, searchers have the opportunity to participate by submitting transactions (txs) they wish to see included at the top of the block proposed for that specific slot. The searchers also have to specify the parent hash of the block on top which they built their ToB txs. The PEPC-Boost relay stores the highest value ToB txs sent for a given slot and parent hash. The value of the ToB transactions is determined by the payout offered by the searcher to the proposer of the block. Note that searchers can only submit txs they want to include in the current slot or the next slot.  

To minimize conflicts with the RoB (Rest of Block), the ToB transactions undergo state interference checks. Specifically, they are screened to identify whether they involve an ETH/USDC swap in the initial versions. In the V0 of PEPC-Boost, we only allow 1 ToB which as mentioned before is a uniswap v3 ETH/USDC swap. In future versions, we plan to expand the slots available for auction in the ToB. This will enable PEPC-Boost to have multiple parallel auctions running for the different slots available to bid for on the ToB. Multiple searchers can compete for the different available slots in the ToB. This auction essentially opens up the blockspace of validators not only the builders but also the searchers.

Searchers submit the ToB txs along with a payout tx to the proposer of the block for the provided slot. They also provide the parent hash on top of which they have built their ToB tx. They submit to the `/relay/v1/builder/tob_txs` endpoint. You can refer to the diagram for the workflow of this endpoint.
